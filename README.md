My goal is to demonstrate how Business Data Analytics (BDA) can help TikTok solve the challenges and issues faced by its users and employees, as well as enhance its strengths, benefits, and unique features. I will use BDA to achieve this:

Customer Analytics: I will use data from sources such as play store and app store to analyze the preferences, behaviors, needs, and satisfaction of TikTok’s customers.

Operations Analytics: I will use data mining, AI/ML to optimize and streamline TikTok’s daily operations in real time.

Account Analytics: I will use data analysis and visualization techniques to evaluate and improve TikTok’s financial performance, health, and compliance based on financial and non-financial data.

People Analytics: I will use data analysis and human resources practices to assess and enhance TikTok’s human capital, talent management, and organizational culture, as well as the performance, engagement, and well-being of its employees.
